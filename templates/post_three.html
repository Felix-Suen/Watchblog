          <p>In a blink of an eye, almost a whole year has past since my ownership of this SKX013. But one year is enough to confirm its significance to me and guarantee its position within my personal collection forever.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">History</h2>

          <p>In this section, I will not be walking through the history of the Seiko SKX line, instead I will be narrating this particular watches’ history on my wrist. The tale begins when my mother was deciding on an 18th birthday present for me. She knew I was especially fond of watches when I was in High School, but she wasn’t a watch nerd. my mother therefore kindly gave me the choice of a watch and she would pay for it with her hard earned cash. The picking was rather easy for me, as I have pretty much planned out my watch purchases for the next 10 years:
</p>

            <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
              <li>Graduate from High School: <b>SKX013 or SARB033</b></li>
              <li>First co-op job: <b>Vintage Omega from the 50s-70s</b></li>
              <li>Graduate from college: <b>Omega Speedmaster Reduced</b></li>
              <li>Gained financial independence: <b>Jaeger Lecoultre</b> (still deciding on the model)</li>
            </ul>

          <p>After some internal debate between the SKX013 and SARB033, I have decided on the diving watch for an extra ease in mind.</p>

          <p>2018 was a particularly difficult year for me. I have been battling severe anxiety and possible depression for a while. I even had to rush to the ER on the day of my 18th birthday. To me, this watch accompanied me through the entire journey of mental health and the importance of family. This watch always reminds me of my mother, who has tirelessly stood by my side, and served as my wall to lean on when everything hurts within me. For the entire year, it has never left my wrist for more than a day. It gives me the courage to fight against anxiety and challenge myself to embark on a month-long backpacking trip to europe, leave the comfort of home to study at the far side of the country, and complete an internship in a foreign country. This watch provides more than just the time, it documents every obstacle in my way.</p>

          <h2>Physical Appearance</h2>

          <p>Anything above 40mm would look comical on my tiny wrist. I have therefore opted for the SKX013 as opposed to the bigger brother SKX007. The case diameter although being 38mm still looks a bit large but manageable on my wrist. The overall case shape and bracelet reminds me of vintage Rolex Datejusts. It is rather reminiscent of an Rolex Oyster case, with the addition of a loose flimsy jubilee bracelet, a throwback to vintage Rolex jubilees (will discuss the bracelet in further detail later). I was initially put off by the look of this watch; however, it somehow slowly releases its joy and character over time.</p>

          <p>The upper surface of the case is machine brushed while the side of the case is smoothly polished. The case finishing is eye catching under full lighting, making it look almost luxurious for a tool watch. The crown is positioned near the 4 o’clock with crown guards flanking its sides. Despite the offset position, it still regularly digs deep into the back of my hands. I am definitely not a fan of the odd position but it is one of those things that truly defines a Seiko dive watch.</p>

          <p>The caseback is deeply stamped with the famous Japanese painting “The Great Wave off Kanagawa”. It is a very pleasant surprise for a watch in the sub-$200 price range.</p>

          <center><img class="img-fluid" src="static/img/caseback.JPG" style="width=600px; height=600px;"></center>

          <p>The dial is a typical diving watch dial, with its oversized hour indexes and hands. All of which are filled with white Super-LumiNova contrasted on a black matt dial to obtain maximum legibility in any lighting condition. Right above the 6 o’clock hour index is an orange text “DIVER’S 200m”, which adds a unique colour to the otherwise utilitarian look. The day-date window is positioned at the 3 o’clock. It is an extremely useful complication for me. Although the dial looks asymmetrical with it, the functionality of it is well worth than a good look.</p>

          <p>Other details include: blue lettering for SAT and red for SUN on the day complication. A chapter ring that surrounds the rim of the hour indexes and has a small cut out where the day-date window is. Black aluminum dive bezel with 60-minute indexes and a little triangle with lume pip at the top. </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Performance</h2>

          <p>The movement performance is surprising good for an entry level mechanical watch. My particular watch loses an average of 9 seconds per day which is well within the Seiko tolerance range of -45 to +30 sec/day. I would simply forward the minute hand by once a week, and the watch will continue to keep accurate time. Of course it is much better than my broken SNK809 of losing 20 minutes a day with the same movement. I also do not have trouble with the power reserve, it has been running non-stop for more than 9 months of daily wear.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Bracelet</h2>

          <p>I have a mix feeling for the bracelet of this watch. The quality of OEM Seiko bracelets are often horrible. However, it is not completely bad with this one. The centre links are finished with high polish while the two sides are brushed. It definitely brings out the dressy side of the watch and make it suitable for other occasions as well. The action of the bracelet has a satisfying click to it and the bracelet although being very flimsy, feels like silk on the skin. It is surprisingly comfortable to wear.</p>

          <p>The downside of such metal silk is that it is too slippery. Although being properly adjusted to my wrist, it is still able to slide down my wrist bone when I am doing certain tasks. The bracelet gets in the way enough for me and I replaced it with some cheap NATO straps.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Price</h2>

          <p>The value proposition is undoubtedly great in this tool watch. Being only under $200 USD with an in-house movement, different finishings on the case, small details to keep me distracted, it is hard to be picky at this price range. Adding on the sentimental value associated to this watch, it becomes invaluable for me. I feel almost privileged to wear this watch everyday. It has gained a permanent spot in my collection.</p>
